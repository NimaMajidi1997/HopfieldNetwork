# HopfieldNetwork

This is a simple Python code for those who are interested in implementing the Hopfield Network. 
Assume that you have some characters such as "M", "A" and etc. You want to store these characters in the Hopfield Network. One of the major benefits of this network is that you can detect noisy characters !


Just run the code, learn and enjoy it !!!
